    <p>The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it. 
        The largest of such objects are the eight planets, in order from the Sun: four terrestrial planets named Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, 
        two gas giants named Jupiter and Saturn, and two ice giants named Uranus and Neptune.
        The terrestrial planets have a definite surface and are mostly made of rock and metal. The gas giants are mostly made of hydrogen and 
        helium, while the ice giants are mostly made of 'volatile' substances such as water, ammonia, and methane. In some texts, these terrestrial
        and giant planets are called the inner Solar System and outer Solar System planets respectively.
        The Solar System was formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud. Over time, the
        cloud formed the Sun and a protoplanetary disk that gradually coalesced to form planets and other objects. That is the reason why all 
        eight planets have an orbit that lies near the same plane. In the present day, 99.86% of the Solar System's mass is in the Sun and most
        of the remaining mass is contained in the planet Jupiter. Six planets, the six largest possible dwarf planets and many other bodies have
        natural satellites or moons orbiting around them. All giant planets and a few smaller bodies are encircled by planetary rings, composed
        of ice, dust and sometimes moonlets. </p>
